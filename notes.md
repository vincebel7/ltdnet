#Known issues and bugs
-Pings don't time out, leaving program hanging when pinging unknown address
-Need to validate input for select network (nonexistent network will cause out of bounds slice index)
-Program requires restart between linking host and being able to DHCP. Saving/reloading doesn't fix this, not sure why
