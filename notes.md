# Known issues and bugs

- Broadcasts aren't handled correctly. Should traverse network instead of a global push to all devices

- Unreachable pings hang on failed ARP requests

# Feature ideas
- MAC learning for hosts (1)

- Flood frame if not in MAC table of switch (2)

- Switch network functionality (3)

- HTTP over UDP (4)

- Multiple routers, with static routing (5)

- Traceroute (after routing is added) (6)

- DNS server (7)
